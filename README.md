## Hello! I'm Dara 

Welcome to my digital realm where pixels dance and vertices play hide and seek. 
I'm a Computer Graphics Enthusiast turned Wizard, mastering the arcane arts of Unreal Engine, Blender, and AI Art Generation.

## About Me

🎨 **Passionate Creator**: I bring imaginary worlds to life with a blend of 3D graphics and a pinch of virtual magic.

🤖 **AI Art Adventurer**: Exploring the uncharted territories of AI art generation, where I teach machines to paint dreams.

👁️ **Computer Visionary**: Constantly on the lookout (literally), finding new ways to make computers see and understand our 3D world as we do.

🎮 **Unreal Tinkerer**: Building landscapes where dragons fly and heroes roam, all within the confines of Unreal Engine.

## My Toolbox 🧰

- **Unreal Engine**: Crafting epic game scenes and not-so-epic bugs.
- **Blender**: My digital clay, shaping the mesh of tomorrow.
- **OpenCV**: Peeking into the matrix of pixels.
- **TensorFlow**: Teaching neural networks to appreciate art.
- **Python & C++**: My trusty sidekicks in all coding duels.
